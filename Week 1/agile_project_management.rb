# A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

# Review a bunch of previous stories that youâ€™ve estimated. Count how many times a story was:
# - more complicated than you expected
# - less complicated than you expected
# - exactly as complicated as you expected
#
# Do you have a tendency to underestimate, overestimate, or are you spot-on most of the time?

I often tend to underestimate projects. Right now I'm working on an ECommerce wordpress site for a friend. I definitely felt that i underestimated it. Not that its too difficult but more so because I never took into consideration the fact that I might get stuck or have trouble with the process.

When it comes to graphic work I tend to overestimate because I like to count the clients feedback and alterations toward the overall project time. Usually client approval takes the longest. Even though I'm making adjustments per their instructions and it may take longer because of that.
